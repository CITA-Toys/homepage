    title: "What is Nervos?"
    content: "Nervos is a network of scaleable and interoperable blockchains built on top of an open network - which we call
                          the Common Knowledge Base (CKB). CKB is built as a security anchor for all blockchains (and layer 2 protocols
                          such as state channels) in the Nervos network. It enables enterprises and application developers to decide
                          what goes into the blockchain."

    title: "How do you compare Nervos with other dApp platforms such as Ethereum, EOS and Cardano?"
    content: "Nervos is a network of interoperable protocols instead of a single blockchain, as commonly in other platforms.
                          The public blockchain (the Nervos CKB) is just one of many components of the network and plays a limited role
                          to provide decentralization and security. The entire Nervos Network together serves as the platform for dApps
                          and protocols."

    title: "From a technical standpoint, what makes the design of Nervos unique?"
    content: "The overall design of Nervos aims to use a layered approach to balance the different tradeoffs of a decentralized
                          system. The Nervos CKB is a public chain designed to provide the most data abstraction power, broadest consensus,
                          and strongest security, without sacrificing decentralization. The Nervos AppChains are optimized for expressiveness,
                          performance, finality and throughput. By separating those concerns, we're able to design specific economics
                          models for each layer to best optimize for their roles in the system. The more modular and specialized design
                          also allows Nervos to evolve quicker than monolithic systems."

    title: "How is Nervos different from other projects aiming to solve the scalability problem?"
    content: "There are quite a few upcoming projects that focus on more efficient consensus algorithms to achieve higher transaction
                          per second (TPS). Consensus algorithms are of critical importance to decentralized systems. However, many consensus
                          algorithms either sacrifice openness of the decentralized system to achieve throughput, or are very experimental
                          and need to be proven in production.
                          <br>
                          <br>The approach that Nervos takes for scalability is through core architectural design. Nervos separates decentralized
                          knowledge and computation, to push the heavy lifting off the main public blockchain. The public blockchain
                          can focus on the common knowledge that needs global consensus and provide security to Nervos AppChains."

    title: "What is the consensus algorithm for Nervos?"
    content: "The algorithm is a hybrid consensus that combines the best of traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and
                          Nakamoto Consensus to give high performance in normal situations and availability when the network partitions.
                          <br>
                          <br>Traditional BFT consensus algorithms can achieve throughput and transaction confirmation speed on par with
                          centralized systems. However, it is difficult for nodes to join or exit freely, and the network's performance
                          decreases rapidly with the increasing number of consensus participating nodes. Traditional BFT consensus algorithms
                          have lower tolerance on network faults. When the network partitions, nodes cannot achieve consensus and the
                          network loses liveliness, making it difficult to meet the availability requirements of permissionless blockchains.
                          <br>
                          <br>The Nakamoto Consensus, popularized by Bitcoinâ€™s Proof of Work, has excellent openness and availability. Nodes
                          in the Bitcoin network may join and exit freely with minimal cost, and the network performance remains constant
                          with more participating nodes. However, its throughput is quite low.
                          <br>
                          <br>In Nervos, the team has combined Nakamoto Consensus and traditional BFT consensus algorithms in a secure way
                          to arrive at a new hybrid consensus algorithm that gives the optimal balance in consistency, availability,
                          fairness, and operational cost."

    title: "What's the use of Nervos native tokens?"
    content: "The Nervos native tokens are used to bond with storage units to store common knowledge in the blockchain. Users
                          pay the storage cost with the token's liquidity, so the cost scales to both space (the size of the knowledge
                          that needs to be saved) and time (the duration that the knowledge needs to be saved) and is better aligned
                          with the ongoing preservation cost of knowledge."

    title: "What is the Nervos value proposition to protocol developers?"
    content: 'For protocol developers, the Nervos CKB offers a versatile settlement engine with features such as built-in cryptographic
                          primitives and "just enough" support for validations. It will be more expressive and efficient as a validation/settlement
                          engine and less likely to introduce bugs than a general purpose Ethereum smart contract platform.'

    title: "What is the roadmap and timeline for Nervos development?"
    content: "Engineering started in January 2018. We will release the Nervos appchain by Q3 2018, along with a blockchain
                          browser Microscope and dApp wallet Neuron. Our testnet is estimated to be ready in Q4 2018 and mainnet in Q2
                          2019."
