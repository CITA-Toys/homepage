  title: 'the scalability trilemma'
  content: 'All blockchains today face the same problem: the scalability trilemma, since <b>global consensus is slow and expensive</b>, adding more nodes aids in decentralization, but hampers speed and overall scalability.<br /><br />It is difficult to support a growing network without sacrificing decentralization and security.'
